# CyberStudents’ Advent of CTF Write-Ups

Advent of CTF is an annual CTF competition organized by CyberStudents, an online organization and community focused on
cybersecurity education. Each competition features beginner-oriented challenges that are released daily in December
leading up to Christmas. Advent of CTF premiered in 2024 and is expected to continue annually with new challenges for
the foreseeable future.

This repository contains community write-ups for all Advent of CTF challenges. The write-ups are organized by year and
day, with each challenge's details, hints, and solutions provided. These write-ups serve as a resource for participants
to learn from and improve their skills in cybersecurity.

The write-ups featured here are written by players and are chosen by the respective challenge developer. In the event
that no suitable write-ups were submitted for a challenge, the challenge developer may provide an official write-up.

There is also a write-up division in the competition. All write-ups submitted by players are graded by the respective
challenge developer who are looking for clarity, completeness, educational value, creativity, and explanation of every
step in their challenge-solving and planning process.

Discussions around each challenge can be found in the
[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/cyberstudents-916144903686336513) under the archived Advent of CTF channel
for each year. Players are encouraged to share their solutions, insights, and questions there. Challenge developers may
also provide clarifications, intended solutions, and additional hints in these channels.
